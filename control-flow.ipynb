    "## What are Loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are blocks of code that execute repeatedly (in a loop) until a condition is met. Usually this condition can be a logical statement or a range. They are a great tool to write shorter code although they should be used carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are often the cause of infinitely running code or particularly slow code, so a bit of care should be taken when writing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always make sure, unless you intend to run it ad infinitum, that the loop has an exit condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break and Continue\n",
    "\n",
    "A break statement will immediately exit the current loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continue statement will skip the rest of the loop and go back to the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Else\n",
    "\n",
    "An else statement at the end of a loop indicates a block of code that will always run after the loop has finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops will execute as long as a Boolean condition is not met, or a break statement is reached.\n"
