    "# Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are collections?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections are special python containers used to store data in an organised fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python ships with 4 main types of collections or data structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries. Each has their uses, pros and cons and we'll go through each one here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordered, Mutable and Unique\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started it is important to get some basic concepts and terminology down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered vs Unordered\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection is said to be ordered if the elements inside the collection are stored in a precise and consistent order. If that is not the case the collection is said to be unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in real life a jar of jellybeans could be considered an unordered collection while your record collection could be considered an ordered one. In other words if the position of an item in a collection is important, maybe because you want to know where it is at any time to retrieve it, you want an ordered collection; if not then unordered will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general unordered collections work better for certain tasks and might perform faster than ordered ones, as we'll see later .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable vs Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutable object, in this case a collection is an object whose value can be changed. An immutable one is one whose value cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the jelly bean jar would be mutable as you are allowed to add or more likely remove jelly beans from it. An immutable example could be the list of ingredients to make a Carbonara. Sure you could change the pecorino for parmesan and the guanciale for bacon, but it wouldn't really be a Carbonara anymore. Seriously. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection is unique if values inside the collection cannot repeat. Say for instance a list of your past partners, you want that to be unique, no sequels, I'm serious dude move on...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are ordered and mutable and probably the most versatile collections in python."
